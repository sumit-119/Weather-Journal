# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.


##  Run the project in Development Mode
The project uses [Node.js >= 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After Node is installed in your system, follow the below steps.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the app.
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/invincisumit/Weather-Journal.git`
3. Now install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json` by running the command `npm install`
4. Launch the app with this command `node server.js`
5. Open [Localhost](https://localhost:3000) in Browser Tab

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
